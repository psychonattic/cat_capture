This will hopefully grow into a more complex program that uses the PiCamera package to take pictures of my cat while I'm away

general notes for usage:

to run the program:
python3 ./file_name.py

to convert .h264 to .mp4:
MP4Box -add file_name.h264 filename.mp4

to play video (on raspberry pi):
omxplayer file_name.mp4

to send from remote server to this machine (local network) use:
scp pi@10.0.0.238:/home/pi/Desktop/pi_camera/file_name.mp4 /Users/joelbarkley/Desktop

to send from remote server to this machine (different network) use:
scp pi@73.78.132.177:/home/pi/Desktop/pi_camera/file_name.mp4 /Users/joelbarkley/Desktop
